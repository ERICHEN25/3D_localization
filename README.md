# 3D Localization of Objects Buried within Granular Materials Using a Distributed 3-Axis Tactile Sensor
In this work, we achieved 3D localization of buried object utilizing a distributed 3-axis tactile sensor. Our approach involves a learning-based prediction model comprising three LSTM models, each dedicated to estimating the distance, direction, and depth of the buried object.
## Models
By categorizing inputs based on whether they originate from a symmetrical tactile array and the presence of induced shear forces, we conducted evaluations across these three scales.
## Evaluation
Our results demonstrates the both presence of multiple taxels and the ability to measure shear forces are essential factors for
accurately localizing buried objects within a 3D space. In addition, it points out the shear forces led by the jamming effect are more crucial than the normal force in 3D localization.
