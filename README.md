# 3D Localization of Objects Buried within Granular Materials Using a Distributed 3-Axis Tactile Sensor
In this work, we achieved 3D localization of buried object utilizing a distributed 3-axis tactile sensor. Our approach involves a learning-based prediction model comprising three LSTM models, each dedicated to estimating the distance, direction, and depth of the buried object.
